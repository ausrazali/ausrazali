### Interests

I've discovered that platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank are excellent for enhancing my skills. To tackle the challenges they offer effectively, I recognize the importance of gaining in-depth knowledge in Data Structures and Algorithms. While these topics are scheduled for my mid-second-year classes, I'm enthusiastic about taking the initiative to self-learn them ahead of time.
